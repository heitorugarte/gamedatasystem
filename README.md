# Game Data System - GDS
Author: Heitor Silveira (heitorsilveirafurb@gmail.com)

iOS App to view games from various platforms, their description, release date and metacritic ratings including a favorites list.

Developed as the final project for my Udacity iOS Nanodegree course.

## Implementation
Implemented in Swift using Core Data to persist the user's favorited games locally on their device.

To list the games and their details, the RawgApi was used (https://rawg.io/apidocs)

## How to build
Clone or download this repository, open the .xcodeproj file and run the app through Xcode.

## Requirements
XCode 12
iOS 14 and newer
